The purpose of this task is writing a base convert class to convert Celcius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit using abstract classes.

  An abstract class is a class that is declared abstractâ€”it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.
  An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), like this:
    abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);

Added java.util.Scanner library to allow user input.
Created a abstract class named "celcius", inside this class created a abstract method named "convert".
Created a class extends from "celcius" abstract class named "fahrenheit".
Created a class extends from "celcius" abstract class named "kelvin".
Programs asks user to input the celcius.
Created a double veriable named "confah" to convert celcius to fahrenheit. The formula is multiply by 1.8 (or 9/5) and add 32.
Created a double veriable named "conkel" to convert celcius to kelvin. The formula is celsius + 273.15.
Printed the results.
