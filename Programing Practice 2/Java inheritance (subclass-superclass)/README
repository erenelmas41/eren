The purpose of this task is to write a Java program to show that member of a super class can be accessed from derived classes.

  In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. 
  We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories: subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class. superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from.

Created a base class named "Bicycle". This class has two fields as "gear" and "speed".
The bicycle class has three methods. Such as; "applyBreak" to decrease the speed, "speedUp" to increase the speed and toString() method to print info of Bicycle.
Derived class is "MountainBike" extends from Bicycle base class. The MountainBike subclass adds one more field as "seatHeight".
The MountainBike subclass has one constructor that invoking base-class(Bicycle).
The MountainBike subclass adds one more method as "setHeight".
Overriding toString() method of Bicycle to print more info.
Creating a new MountainBike as mb and entering the values.
Printing the results.
