The purpose of this task is to Write a program to multiply two matrices: A[.3,3] and B[3;3].Matrix elements are integers. 
Initiate a matrix elements using a random method in the range 1 to 9. Output: A[3;3], B[3;3] and matrix multiplication result C[3][3].

  Multidimensional Arrays can be defined in simple words as array of arrays. Data in multidimensional arrays are stored in tabular form (in row major order).
  
Adding java.Util.Scanner to allow user input.
Creating a new scanner named sc.
Asking user to enter the base of the square matrix.
Creating three new two dimensional arrays as a,b,c.
Asking user to enter the elements of the array a (User can enter elements as much as they stated, same for other array too).
Asking user to enter the elements of the array b.
Elemets of the array c are multiplies of array a and b.
Outpringting the result of multiplied array.
