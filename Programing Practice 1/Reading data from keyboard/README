This task is the very beginning of the Java to learn the data types, veriables, arithmetic operations, formatting and outputing the result.
This program asks user to input data from keyboard.

Created three veriables. 
First one is a integer that stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
Secong one is a double that stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits.
Third one is a float that stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits.

Imported java.util.Scanner library to allow user input. Created a new scanner named "scan". Asking for the first entry and scanning the integer input. 
Asking for the second entry and scanning the next double input. Asking for the third entry and scanning the next float input.

Used this three veriables for four mathematical operations.
Because of we are using integer and double/float veriables in operations, output of the results has lots of fraction. To prevent this we do formating for numeric output.
To do the formating write "String.format("'converter'",'the operation')".
There are different converters. Such as;
  %d > for decimal integers
  %f > for float
  %n > a new line character appropriate to the platform running the application. you should always use %n, rather than \n
  %tB > a date & time conversion—locale-specific full name of month
  %td, %te > a date & time conversion—2-digit day of month. td has leading zeroes as needed, te does not
  %tl > a date & time conversion—hour in 12-hour clock
