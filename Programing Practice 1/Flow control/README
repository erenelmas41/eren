Purpose of this task is creating a program that prints multiplication table for all the numbers from 1 to 10.
Used the tabulator character (\t) to align the values.

Simply created two veriables
Created a for loop for veriable 'a' that goes from 1 to 10.
Created another for loop for veriable 'b' inside the first one that goes from 1 to 10 as well. 
In this loop multiply the veriables we created and align them with '\t'.
Lastly inside the first for loop wrote 'println' to go next line of the table.
